# The blockchain domain [](https://github.com/positivedefinite/kernelofknowledge)

List of links to build up your blockchain intuition. Contributions are welcome.

## Knowledge
* [Truth about blockchain](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain) - Blockchain as a fundamental rather than a disruptive technology. After TCP/IP was created in 1972 many companeis created <i> localized networks </i>.
* [?](https://hbr.org/2016/05/the-impact-of-the-blockchain-goes-beyond-financial-services?referral=03759&cm_vc=rr_item_page.bottom) - Blockchains ensure integrity and trust between strangers. They make it difficult to cheat. The Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything.
